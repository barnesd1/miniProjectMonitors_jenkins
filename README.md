## This is a Mini Project for the NatWest QA Software Engineer Course - A CRUD Website for Selling Computer Monitors (from the Admin perspective)
#
## Tools used:
#####	• Spring Tools Suite 4
#####	• Java v11 with Spring API

## Project Details:
#####	• Why are we doing this?
######	The is the first assessment of cohorts of the course
#####	• How I expected the challenge to go.
######	I knew the Spring method of creating apis well enough to be confident with this aspect.  I was unsure how to call the apis from javascript and have the result displayed in the browser.
#####	• What went well?
######	I knew I could complete the task within the allocated time and without the need to work over the weekend.  I did spend some time on Friday evening to view some YouTube videos on the fetch api with javascript.
#####	• What didn't go as planned?
######	Fortunately I found a brilliant video on YouTube showing and example of using the Fetch Api and rendering this to html.  Without this I dont think I would have been able to complete the front end side.
#####	• Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
######	Add more fields like product codes, product descriptions, stock quantity
######	Allow selecting monitors items from the list, maybe edit in-situ using some grid control
######	Add JUnit tests
######  Site is for Admin users, add a customer view
######	Allow customer to buy an item with a shopping cart
######	Add security logins
